        With this free and open-source tool, you can effortlessly capture your
        screen, webcam, and microphone. Whether you need to create tutorials,
        showcase presentations, or simply share your thoughts, this app has got
        you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, hit the “Start record” button and grant your browser
        permission to access your microphone, screen and/or webcam. Once they’re
        selected, a countdown will begin and the app will start capturing
        high-quality video and audio simultaneously, but separately. This
        separation allows for greater flexibility when it comes to downloading
        and editing your recordings.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing your recording, you'll have the option to preview both
        the video and audio tracks. If everything looks good, you can either
        download them individually or conveniently merge them into a single
        file. The choice is yours!
      </p>
      <p>
        No need to worry about creating an account, complicated setups, or
        hidden costs. Simply enjoy the seamless experience of recording,
        previewing, and downloading your recordings with ease.
