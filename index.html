    <h1>Record your screen and webcam</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my screen and audio recording web app! With this free and
      open-source tool, you can effortlessly capture your screen, webcam, and
      microphone. Whether you need to create tutorials, showcase presentations,
      or simply share your thoughts, this app has got you covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, grant your browser permission to access your screen and/or
      webcam. Once you're ready, hit the record button, and my app will start
      capturing high-quality video and audio separately. This separation allows
      for greater flexibility when it comes to downloading and editing your
      recordings.
    </p>
    After finishing your recording, you'll have the option to preview both the
    video and audio tracks. If everything looks good, you can either download
    them individually or conveniently merge them into a single file. The choice
    is yours!
    <p>
      I've designed this app to be user-friendly and accessible. No need to
      worry about complicated setups or hidden costs. Simply enjoy the seamless
      experience of recording, previewing, and downloading your recordings with
      ease.
